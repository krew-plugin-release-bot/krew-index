  shortDescription: >-
    Restart cluster nodes sequentially and gracefully
  homepage: https://github.com/mnrgreg/kubectl-node-restart
  caveats: |
    Execution of this plugin requires Kubernetes cluster-admin Rolebindings
    and the ability to schedule Privileged Pods.
  description: |
    This plugin performs a sequential, rolling restart of selected nodes by first
    draining each node, then running a Kubernetes Job to reboot each node, and
    finally uncordoning each node when Ready.
