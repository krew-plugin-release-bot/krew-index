  shortDescription: Set custom output format for specific resources/namespaces.
  homepage: https://github.com/GrigoriyMikhalkin/kubectl-output
  description: |
    This plugin allows you to set custom outputs for specific resources/namespaces. 
    Fo that to work you'll need to use kubectl-output as a wrapper for `kubectl get ...` command.
    Either by running `kubectl output get ...` or using alias `ko="kubectl output"; ko get ...`.
