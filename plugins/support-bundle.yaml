  shortDescription: Creates support bundles for off-cluster analysis
  homepage: https://github.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot
  description: |
    This plugin collects information about the cluster, and automatically
    redacts sensitive data from being collected. This can optionally include
    application-specific data.  The plugin writes the collected files into a
    single archive named support-bundle.tar.gz. This archive can be manually
    inspected or uploaded to https://vendor.replicated.com for automated
    analysis.

    Application developers can create and host a Collector manifest that
    defines information to be collected.

    For information on creating a Collector manifest, view the documentation
    at https://help.replicated.com/docs/troubleshoot/kubernetes/collectors/defining-collectors/

    Usage:
      $ kubectl support-bundle <uri>

      where <uri> references a set of application collectors

      For example:

      $ kubectl support-bundle https://troubleshoot.replicated.com

    For additional options:
      $ kubectl support-bundle --help
