  shortDescription: Monitor, launch and manage flyte executions
  description: |
      Kubectl-flyte can be used to manage workflows in a kubernetes cluster executed
      by FlytePropeller. Users can monitor, visualize executing workflows, delete or
      terminate executions in bulk, and dive into quota utilization for tenants. The
      tool allows users to launch yaml based Flyte workflows without FlyteAdmin.
