  shortDescription: "Discover and access clusters"
  description: |
    kconnect is a tool that can be used to discover and securely access Kubernetes 
    clusters across multiple operating environments.
    Based on the authentication mechanism chosen the CLI will discover Kubernetes 
    clusters you are allowed to access in a target hosting environment (i.e. EKS, AKS, Rancher) 
    and generate a kubeconfig for a chosen cluster.
    Features:
    - Authenticate using SAML or Azure Active Directory 
    - Discover EKS, AKS & Rancher clusters
    - Generate a kubeconfig for a cluster
    - Query history of connected servers
    - Regenerate the kubeconfig from your history by using an id or an alias
    - Import defaults values for your company
  caveats: |
    This plugin currently only supports EKS, AKS and Rancher
