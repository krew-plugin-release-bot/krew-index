  shortDescription: Collect cluster state and serve it via an API server
  description: |
    `crust-gather` is a useful cluster debugging tool.
    It allows user to collect full or partial cluster state
    via a selection of filters. The desired set of resources
    can be reduced or extended based on GVK or namespace
    selection.

    `crust-gather` collects pod logs across the cluster.
    The tool also allows collecting custom logs from
    the node itself, such as kubelet logs.

    It is a common requirement to remove secret data from the
    output, so `crust-gather` provides flags and configuration
    options to exclude secret data from any collected content.

    ```bash
    $ kubectl crust-gather collect --help
    $ kubectl crust-gather collect
    ```

    To simplify the debugging process, `crust-gather` supports
    serving the collected archive via an embedded API server
    replica, which is compatible with kubectl or k9s clients.

    ```bash
    $ kubectl crust-gather serve --help
    $ kubectl crust-gather serve &
    ```
  caveats: |
    * Serving the archive overrides current KUBECONFIG
      or the ~/.kube/config file.
    * Tool is intended for cluster administrators, with
      high RBAC privileges, or test (temporary) clusters.
    * Cluster-wide watch recording and replaying functionality
      is also supported, but it is best effort only.
