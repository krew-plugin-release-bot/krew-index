  shortDescription: List community owned container images running
  homepage: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/community-images
  description: |
    The plugin will scan for all pods in all namespaces that you have at least
    read access to. The output is a list of all images, with the community
    owned images in red, and the rest of the images in green. It also prints
    some tips to ensure you are using the correct official repository.

    For additional options:
      $ kubectl community-images --help
      or https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/community-images/blob/master/doc/USAGE.md
